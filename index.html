			<h1>Kalooh User Manual</h1>
      <a href="index.html">User Manual</a>
      <a href="developerguide.html">Developer Guide</a>
			<p>Kallooh is a social media app that lets users post “notes” based on their current location and allows others in the area to view and comment on these notes.</p>	

			<br>

			<p>While many social media apps exist to connect users, there are none that sufficiently emphasize location as a medium of communicating with people in a given area. Our app, Kalooh, aims to fill this niche by giving users a way to interact with their surroundings and see others reactions as well. By focusing on location-based interaction, we can connect users in a way that is more personal and visible to each user.</p>
